## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project includes several core features that mirror real-world booking platform functionality.  
Each feature is designed to enhance the user experience while ensuring business logic and technical scalability.  

### 1. User Management
- Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely.  
- Supports different roles (Guest, Host, Admin) with appropriate permissions and access control.  
- Ensures secure authentication and authorization for all users.  

### 2. Property Management
- Enables hosts to list new properties with details such as title, description, location, and pricing.  
- Provides functionality for editing, updating, and deleting property listings.  
- Allows users to browse and search for properties by filters like location, price, and availability.  

### 3. Booking System
- Guests can book available properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates.  
- Ensures validation of property availability to prevent double bookings.  
- Provides booking management (view, cancel, confirm) for both guests and hosts.  

### 4. Reviews & Ratings
- Allows guests to leave feedback and ratings for properties they have stayed in.  
- Helps build trust and credibility for hosts while guiding future guests in their decision-making.  
- Supports moderation to prevent abuse and maintain quality standards.  

### 5. Payments Integration
- Facilitates secure payments for bookings using multiple payment methods (e.g., card, PayPal, bank transfer).  
- Tracks payment status (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and links payments to specific bookings.  
- Enhances trust and ensures smooth financial transactions between guests and hosts.  

### 6. Security Features
- Implements key measures like data encryption, password hashing, and secure API endpoints.  
- Protects users from common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, CSRF, and unauthorized access.  
- Ensures compliance with best practices for secure transactions and data handling.  

### 7. CI/CD & Deployment
- Automates code testing, building, and deployment using GitHub Actions.  
- Ensures continuous integration of new features while minimizing errors.

---

These features collectively provide the foundation of a robust booking platform, ensuring scalability, usability, and trustworthiness for both hosts and guests.


### Relationships

- A **User** can list multiple **Properties**.  
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.  
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings**.  
- A **Property** can have multiple **Reviews** (from different users).  
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Payment**, but a payment belongs to one booking.  
- A **User** can write multiple **Reviews**, each linked to a property.  

---

This relational design ensures data consistency, integrity, and efficiency in handling core operations like reservations, payments, and reviews.

## API Security

Securing backend APIs is a critical component of the Airbnb Clone Project. Since the platform handles sensitive information such as user data, property details, bookings, and payments, strong security measures are required to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.  

### Key Security Measures

#### 1. Authentication

- Ensures that only registered users can access the system.  
- Implemented using secure protocols such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2.  
- Protects user accounts by verifying identity before granting access.  

#### 2. Authorization

- Defines what actions different user roles (Guest, Host, Admin) can perform.  
- Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they do not own.  
- For example, a host can edit their property listing, but not someone else’s.  

#### 3. Data Encryption

- Uses HTTPS/TLS to secure data transmission between clients and servers.  
- Encrypts sensitive information such as passwords and payment details before storage.  
- Protects user data from eavesdropping and unauthorized access.  

#### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling

- Limits the number of API requests from a single client within a given time.  
- Prevents abuse such as denial-of-service (DoS) or brute-force login attempts.  
- Ensures system stability under heavy traffic.  

#### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization

- Validates all user inputs before processing.  
- Prevents common attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and malicious payloads.  
- Ensures integrity of data stored in the database.  

#### 6. Secure Payment Handling

- Integrates with trusted payment gateways that follow PCI-DSS compliance.  
- Ensures sensitive payment details are never stored in plain text.  
- Protects users from fraud and ensures trust in financial transactions.  

---

### Why Security Is Crucial

- **Protecting User Data**: Sensitive personal information must remain private and secure.  
- **Securing Payments**: Financial transactions require strict compliance and encryption.  
- **Maintaining Trust**: Strong security practices increase user confidence in the platform.  
- **Preventing Fraud & Abuse**: Safeguards the system from malicious users and bots.  
- **Ensuring Compliance**: Meets industry standards for data protection and privacy.  

---

By implementing these security measures, the Airbnb Clone Project ensures a safe, trustworthy, and reliable platform for all users.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a set of practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** ensures that every code change is automatically tested and integrated into the main codebase.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** automates the release of updates to production, ensuring faster delivery and fewer errors.  

### Why CI/CD is Important for This Project

- **Improved Collaboration**: Every team member’s changes are automatically tested and merged, reducing conflicts.  
- **Faster Development Cycle**: New features and bug fixes can be deployed quickly without manual intervention.  
- **Reduced Errors**: Automated tests catch issues early before they reach production.  
- **Scalability**: The system remains stable and reliable as new features are added.  
- **Consistency**: Ensures deployments are reproducible and consistent across environments.  

### Tools for CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows such as building, testing, and deploying code directly from GitHub.  
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent runtime environments by packaging the application and its dependencies into containers.  
- **Testing Frameworks**: Integrated into CI to validate code functionality (e.g., Django testing tools, Pytest).  
- **Deployment Platforms**: Can include cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, or Heroku) for hosting the application.
