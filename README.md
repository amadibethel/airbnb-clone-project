## Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project leverages a modern technology stack to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance.  
Each technology plays a unique role in the development and deployment process:

### 1. Django

- A high-level Python web framework used to build robust and scalable backend systems.  
- Provides built-in features like authentication, ORM, and security tools.  
- Facilitates rapid development of APIs and business logic.  

### 2. MySQL

- A relational database management system used to store, manage, and query structured data.  
- Ideal for managing user accounts, bookings, payments, and property listings.  
- Ensures data consistency, relationships, and optimized queries for high performance.  

### 3. GraphQL

- A query language and runtime for APIs that provides flexible data fetching.  
- Allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching.  
- Enhances efficiency when integrating complex relationships between users, listings, and bookings.  

### 4. Docker

- A containerization platform that enables consistent application environments across development, testing, and production.  
- Simplifies deployment by packaging code, dependencies, and configuration into portable containers.  
- Ensures scalability and reliability in distributed environments.  

### 5. GitHub & Git

- **Git**: Version control system for tracking code changes and enabling team collaboration.  
- **GitHub**: Cloud platform for managing repositories, reviewing code, and facilitating collaborative workflows.  
- Supports branching, pull requests, and code reviews for smooth collaboration.  

### 6. GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

- Automates build, test, and deployment pipelines.  
- Ensures continuous integration by testing new code before merging.  
- Facilitates continuous delivery for faster and more reliable releases.

This technology stack ensures the Airbnb Clone Project is built using modern, industry-standard tools, providing a strong foundation for scalability, security, and maintainability.

## Database Design

The Airbnb Clone Project uses a **relational database (MySQL)** to manage structured data.  
The schema is designed to handle users, listings, bookings, reviews, and payments efficiently.  

### Key Entities and Fields

#### 1. Users

- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `name` (Full name of the user)  
- `email` (Unique identifier for login)  
- `password_hash` (Encrypted password for authentication)  
- `role` (Guest, Host, or Admin)  

#### 2. Properties

- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
- `title` (Property name/heading)  
- `description` (Details about the property)  
- `location` (City, country, or address)  
- `price_per_night` (Cost for booking per night)  

#### 3. Bookings

- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)  
- `check_in_date`  
- `check_out_date`  
- `status` (Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled)  

#### 4. Reviews

- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)  
- `rating` (e.g., 1–5 stars)  
- `comment` (Review text)  
- `created_at`  

#### 5. Payments

- `id` (Primary Key)  
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings)  
- `amount` (Total payment made)  
- `payment_method` (Card, Bank Transfer, PayPal, etc.)  
- `status` (Paid, Failed, Refunded)  
- `created_at`  

---

### Relationships

- A **User** can list multiple **Properties**.  
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.  
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings**.  
- A **Property** can have multiple **Reviews** (from different users).  
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Payment**, but a payment belongs to one booking.  
- A **User** can write multiple **Reviews**, each linked to a property.  

---

This relational design ensures data consistency, integrity, and efficiency in handling core operations like reservations, payments, and reviews.

## API Security

Securing backend APIs is a critical component of the Airbnb Clone Project. Since the platform handles sensitive information such as user data, property details, bookings, and payments, strong security measures are required to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.  

### Key Security Measures

#### 1. Authentication

- Ensures that only registered users can access the system.  
- Implemented using secure protocols such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2.  
- Protects user accounts by verifying identity before granting access.  

#### 2. Authorization

- Defines what actions different user roles (Guest, Host, Admin) can perform.  
- Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they do not own.  
- For example, a host can edit their property listing, but not someone else’s.  

#### 3. Data Encryption

- Uses HTTPS/TLS to secure data transmission between clients and servers.  
- Encrypts sensitive information such as passwords and payment details before storage.  
- Protects user data from eavesdropping and unauthorized access.  

#### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling

- Limits the number of API requests from a single client within a given time.  
- Prevents abuse such as denial-of-service (DoS) or brute-force login attempts.  
- Ensures system stability under heavy traffic.  

#### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization

- Validates all user inputs before processing.  
- Prevents common attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and malicious payloads.  
- Ensures integrity of data stored in the database.  

#### 6. Secure Payment Handling

- Integrates with trusted payment gateways that follow PCI-DSS compliance.  
- Ensures sensitive payment details are never stored in plain text.  
- Protects users from fraud and ensures trust in financial transactions.

### Why Security Is Crucial

- **Protecting User Data**: Sensitive personal information must remain private and secure.  
- **Securing Payments**: Financial transactions require strict compliance and encryption.  
- **Maintaining Trust**: Strong security practices increase user confidence in the platform.  
- **Preventing Fraud & Abuse**: Safeguards the system from malicious users and bots.  
- **Ensuring Compliance**: Meets industry standards for data protection and privacy.

By implementing these security measures, the Airbnb Clone Project ensures a safe, trustworthy, and reliable platform for all users.
