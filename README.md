- Ensures data integrity, security, and backup strategies.  
- Optimizes queries and database performance for scalability.  

### 3. DevOps Engineer

- Sets up and manages CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).  
- Oversees containerization and deployment using Docker.  
- Ensures smooth integration and delivery of new features.  
- Implements monitoring, logging, and system reliability measures.  

### 4. Security Engineer

- Implements best practices for application and API security.  
- Protects the system from threats such as SQL injection, CSRF, and data breaches.  
- Ensures secure authentication, authorization, and encryption of sensitive data.  

### 5. Frontend Developer (Optional extension if UI is considered later)

- Builds the user interface for the platform.  
- Works with backend developers to integrate APIs and deliver a seamless user experience.  
- Ensures responsiveness and accessibility across devices.  

### 6. Project Manager / Product Owner

- Oversees project planning, coordination, and documentation.  
- Facilitates collaboration between team members.
